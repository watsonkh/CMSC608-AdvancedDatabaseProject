We are building a recipe database, what should the users be able to do?

1. **Users** may lookup **recipes** by **ingredient**.
2. **Users** may filter **recipes** by:

    * dietary restrictions/preferences
    * estimated duration of cooking time
    * estimated cost of meal per serving
    * estimated calories per serving
    * serving size
    * type of cuisine (italian, vietnamese, indian, ... )
    * required kitchen tools (e.g., a stand mixer)

3. **Users** may input a list of the **ingredients** they currently have and retrieve **recipes** ranked by most similar ingredient lists.
4. **Users** may input an image of the **dish** they want to make and retrieve **recipes** with similar image thumbnails.
