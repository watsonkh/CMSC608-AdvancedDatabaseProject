Once baked, the berries sink into the cake and burst, becoming a built-in layer of fresh jam, while the crumble melts and crisps into a cookie-like crust that provides wonderful textural contrast. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or at room temperature with a cup of steaming coffee in the morning.",

There are many ways to speed this up and still have it come out just as tasty. Crushing up chopped peppers in a mortal and pestle is very time consuming. Next time I'll use a food processor. The texture won't be exactly the same, but they end up all getting pureed in the soup anyway. I made the peanut butter from scratch, as suggested, but to shorten the time, just use about 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I doubled the sweet potatoes and it needed it. Two small sweet potatoes for 2 cans of coconut milk and vegetable broth is not enough texture or flavor. Lastly, large chopped kale, added at the end, to an already pureed soup, was just not palatable (and I love kale). I ended up pureeing the kale into the soup. It left little green specks, which were lovely, and I wasn't getting soggy chucks of mushy kale stuck in my teeth. Top the soup with chopped peanuts, some hot sauce and chopped cilantro. It's a beautiful and tasty soup that I'll make again, with the shortcuts."

And while I know that the ‘recipe authors’ timing never really quite matches that of the ‘home chef’, really it just took way too long (I will blame my vodka cranberry tomorrow!) Harumph! \nThe flavor on the other hand was quite delicious! My teenager, ‘the one who does not like sweet potatos’ loved the soup … ‘did I say sweet potato, or carrot soup (she loves carrots) hehe ;),;).\nChanges:\n-Instead of using coconut milk, I used coconut cream. It was a minor oversight at the grocery store today, but thought the mistake worked out quite well. \n-I doubled the amount of ginger (We love ginger)\n-And, while I started out using my mortar and pestal to grind the green onion, ginger, Serrano peppers, and garlic I ended up tossing them into \nthe food processor as my hands were exhausted. \n- As for the peanuts … I just used a dough roller to chop for the garnish and food processor to make the peanut paste."

Did not have a mortar and pestle, so just threw the minced garlic, grated ginger, and half the chopped scallions and japlapeno into the hot oil for 30-60 seconds, then dumped in the two cans of coconut milk, chicken stock, and sweet potatoes, bringing it to a boil.\n\nOnce the sweet potatoes were tender, I mixed in the cup of peanut butter, then used an immersion blender to thicken. Then, I threw in a huge handful of frozen, pre-chopped kale and while it simmered, cut the lime into wedges - I used the juice from the whole lime. The acidity added nice balance to the flavor. Salt to taste.\n\nI also added Sriracha. Sambal Oelek would be nice too instead of regular hot sauce. I garnished with the remaining scallions and jalapeno, and I didn't even bother with the rice.\n\nIt didn't look as pretty as the one in the picture, but it tasted great and was a lot less labor intensive!"

The high sugar content means that you're not at risk for botulism. Sterilize your jars and flat lids for canning, fill the just-drained jars w/hot jam, wipe the rim, add the flat lid &amp; ring, tighten reasonably, and invert on a towel for 10-15 minutes. The turn the jars right-side up and let cool to room temperature. The heat from the jam will melt the lid seal enough to work and you can test the seal on the room temperature jars by pressing on the lid. If they haven't sealed, the jam is still fine, just needs to be refrigerated. The towel is in case a jar hasn't sealed and leaks all over the counter. \n\nLikewise, because of the acidity, you can get by w/a water bath treatment for things like pickles and chutneys.\n\nOnce you start dealing with a low-acidity fruit like tomatoes, and particularly tomatoes combined with other veggies, botulism is a very real risk. I'm guessing that if you looked up the recommeded pressure &amp; timing in a Ball canning book for a tomato mixture, you could use that as a guideline. Otherwise, you should check with your county's farm advisor or a find the equivalent on the state level. \n\nAnd what do you mean you're not using your pressure canner? Haven't you been reading Kenji's recipes for using a pressure cooker?\n\nAnd yes, I know the comments I made on his recipe for the corn soup should have been for a corn <b>cob</b> and not a corn husk."

This only served 2 of us; we just could not stop eating! Served with brown rice and butter lettuce (*I live with an iceberg lettuce hater*). It's the sort of dish you can serve to people who think they won't like tofu, and they'll find themselves eating every last bite and then pouting when there's not enough for thirds. The jicama is brilliant. The pine nuts and cilantro seemed odd to me in the recipe, but they worked so well in this dish. I just finished eating and am already plotting on when I can get this into the rotation again."

With the chicken on its back, slip the string under the tail and bring the ends up over the legs to form a figure eight. Loop over the end of each leg and draw the strings tight to bring the legs together. Draw the string back under the legs and wings on either side of the neck. Pull tight, wrap one end around the neck, and tie off the two ends. Salt the chicken evenly all around. Coarse salt has a good texture of large grains that makes it easy to calibrate how much salt you are putting on the chicken; sprinkle it from up high, so that it falls like snow. Season liberally with fresh-ground pepper."

Prepare the bird as he states, but season the cavity heavily with salt, add some black pepper and stuff it with a lemon half, a split garlic head, thyme and rosemary. Sprinkle the outside with salt and pepper and pan sear the leg, breast and other leg in a 10-inch diameter saute pan. \n\nWhen it's equally golden brown, remove it from the heat but keep it in the saute pan, flip on it's back and rub evenly with unsalted butter (pommade consistency). Pop in the oven at 400 F for 10 minutes, then reduce to 375-380 F. Cook for 35-45 minutes, basting with the butter every 10 minutes.

I would like to add a hint to those who found the dough to come out too soft and sticky, or who needed to add more flour to make it workable: Add the second half of the water to the flour/lard mixture a couple of teaspoons at a time and then pulse for a few seconds in between. The mixture will appear to change very little as you add the water, but you will reach a point where suddenly the dough will start forming into a ball. At this point, do not add ANY more water! Adding even small amounts of water now will quickly turn your dough sticky and too soft. Adding flour to a too-wet dough is much more difficult than adding water to a too-dry dough. Just pulse the food processor a little longer until almost all of the dough sticks into a ball, and then move on to the kneading step."

This is so much easier than I thought it would be. Forgot to buy taco shells today and decided to try this. I have a farm source for leaf lard down the street. I have been experimenting with it recently, making pie crusts, biscuits and now these. I feel like the less preservatives and sugar I use is a win......everything at the store has sugar in it, EVERYTHING....its poison."

I didn’t want to add TOO much flour because it would have a floury flavor. They came out fine.\n\nBut I made it work and they were delicious. Kudos to the recipe. I knew the dough was too soft because it didn’t make a ball, but I managed to get 12 tortillas out of what I whipped up.\n\nSo, don’t be afraid! Even if your dough is imperfect you will have delicious tortillas. The salt was very necessary in case anyone wants to omit it. It made a big difference in taste."

I used regular sized potato buns and wider diameter patties. I sliced the onions super thin instead of grating them and used some water to get more liquid. I let the patties cook for about 15 seconds on one side, pressed some diced onions on the raw side and flipped them. After that I did the rest of the steps with my pan mostly covered. First I let the buns steam (just about 15) then set them aside. Next I let the cheese melt over the patties (covered) to finish it up. The burgerlets came out so juicy with a really great onion flavor.\n\nWhen I make the larger batch I'm gonna follow your directions exactly and expect they'll be even better than what I got today. Can't wait!"

I have an oven thermometer and a ThermaPen, so I know the temperatures were right. I cooked everything exactly as described, but the pig was already at 180 after only 2.5 hours. I took it out and let it cool for about 45 mins, the put it back in at 500. After 45 minutes the skin still wasn't crisp. I took it out after an hour at 500 because it was smoking. Although it did taste really porky and delicious, the meat was overcooked and dry. The skin was like leather, no one liked it. All in all it was a total failure and waste of almost $300. I feel bad for the poor little guy."

In my case, the pig is sitting on its legs, so the back of the big tends to brown faster than the rest, as it is near the top of the oven. I have to usually cover the top with foil at some point."

Some are merely Mai tai variations with extra rum, while some call for brandy instead of bourbon, and others for rum. Today&#39;s drink historians generally settle on bourbon as one of the two base spirits, along with a shot of gin. The drink is then leavened with the healing powers of lime juice and bitters (the lime juice can range anywhere from a teaspoon to an ounce) and lengthened with a good dose of ginger ale.",

Used a mixture of chopped fresh tomatoes and passata for the tomato portion.\n\n It was absolutely fantastic, best tofu dish I've had. Such a luxurious texture.

I followed Kenji's separate article for dry-brining (3 nights). I used Trader Joe's prepared mire poix rather than chop my own veg (2 containers as I used a double-size tray for the turkey). I cooked until a leg was at 167 and took the tray out (fearing that I would have dried out meat if I went to 170 as the recipe directs, given that the tray would go back in at 500 for 30 minutes). Looking at the pale, salty skin when it came out of the oven the first time, I was nervous that it would not properly crisp up and that the meat would be dry with the high-temp additional cooking. I should not have feared - it crisped up perfectly to a beautiful golden brown in 30 minutes and the meat was juicy and delicious! We all agreed it was our best turkey ever. For the gravy, I used a shortcut as well: Trader Joe's makes a good prepared gravy that can be doctored up to delicious. I couldn't fit all of my turkey parts on the tray for the oven so I seared and braised a couple of thighs in a dutch oven on the stove, and then added the drippings (judiciously) to the store-bought gravy. Quick, easy, and very tasty gravy."

That can break them down too much. Instead, bring them to a soft peak only before moving to step #4. I did that plus the other fixes that seemed to help (room temperature eggs, high sided plan, wrapped with damp towel and cooled upside-down). The result was a perfectly level cake, and moreover, the cake really absorbed the tres leches soak quickly. This fix worked so well that I will skip the other steps in the next go around to see if those aides are really needed."

(Soak overnight!)\n\nOne problem with the overall recipe is that it lacks a bit of \"depth\" as written -- it's just pure milkiness. I think there are a couple of opportunities to make it even better:\n\n- The \"sauce\" can be enhanced by turning one or both cans of condensed milk into dulce de leche\n- It can be further enhanced with the addition of a shot of rum or brandy\n- A dusting of cinnamon under the whipped cream mixture is highly recommended - really brings things together. I think a very small amount of cocoa powder could be interesting too.\n- The cream cheese in the whipped cream mix really helps cut the sweetness. I went a bit further by dropping the sugar level just a bit, and I added a bit of almond extract to get a bit more mileage out of that component.\n- Garnish with fruit! Strawberries especially are highly recommended."

In fact, once you get the simple syrup (recommended) and bitters mixture going (and technically you should use orange bitters in addition to Angostura), throw in the orange rind and muddle to release the oils of the orange rind. That will give the drink a next-level authenticity. Stir 50 times with a 2\" ice cube. Do NOT add maraschino cherries, which are basically candy. Instead, add 1-2 Luxardo cherries. So, in total, orange rind and luxardos, NOT orange slice and maraschinos."

Whether you want to call that by a different name than a classic old fashioned is immaterial...those drinks are awesome.\n\nMay I suggest to others who enjoy an occasional sloppy old fashioned--my particular recipe is to muddle (I use normal proportions--teaspoon of sugar, slice of orange, cherry and three dashes bitters). Then stir in 1oz of Rye. Then pack the glass with CRUSHED ice (just wrap the ice in a towel and beat it to hell) and top the glass off with Rye.\n\nIt's basically a Rye snow cone but the trick is that the head of the drink is basically pure whiskey with no sweetness and then the drink gets sweeter as you get to the bottom of the glass. The beauty of this is the second (and subsequent) rounds, because after enjoying the sweet frutiness of the end of the drink your next round cleanses your palate less sweet rye at the top.\n\nTry it--you'll love it!"

Pulp is not preferable in a cocktail. Feel free to muddle the rind with your sugar liquid and bitters, which will help bring out the aromatics of the orange. Stir 50x with a large ice cube (2\" preferred). That's an Old Fashioned. Also, I prefer mine with Rye, not Bourbon, because Bourbon is already sweet, and adding sugar will just make it sweeter. Rye and sugar are a great offsetting combo."

They satisfy my craving for many things at once; a little cake, a little frozen mousse, and a surprise bit of fresh fruit, jelly, or nuts. Best of all, they have a gorgeous, smooth shell of chocolate that looks as beautiful as it tastes, giving you the dramatic payoff of a plated dessert with just a little effort.",

I've made it about a dozen times and:\n\n1) I've made this with chicken and with duck and find that it comes out best when I DON'T put the either back in until the very end, just long enough to cook through. The beans are incredibly flavorful with the fat, salt pork, and simmered (but removed!) aromatics, and the chicken does dry out and the brown crust gets soggy in the pot for the entire time in the oven.\nSame for the sausage, which ALWAYS gets mealy after hours in the oven (and I've tried different kinds of sausage).\n\n2) The BEST versions I've made forgo chicken and use prepared duck confit legs (from D'Artagnan, sold at my local megamart, or from my local butcher), browned after the salt pork and then shredded and added at the very end.\n\n3) This tastes richer and more complex with homemade stock (I don't bother with the gelatin in this case). I've also used chicken fat skimmed from making stock instead of the duck fat when I've used duck confit instead of chicken legs! Fewer specialty ingredients this way.\n\n3) No need to peel the garlic! I do cut a few slits into the cloves through the papery skin before I throw the whole head in, though.\n\n4) The cloves kind of float to the top or are otherwise easy to spot when giving the beans a gentle stir before putting in the oven.\n\n5) I forgot to soak the beans once or twice and just cooked the entire pot a little longer ... it turned out great, with no adverse effects on the bean texture!"

I didn't soak the beans overnight, but gave the whole thing about an hour and a half extra. Looking at the full article attached to the recipe article, this seems a really minor issue, so long as you monitor and adjust liquid/time accordingly. I also used Great Northern beans, since I wasn't able to find dried Cannellini beans. Also for full disclosure, I misread the full article and included minced garlic equivalent to a head (hey; I love the stuff), and I used spicy Portuguese sausage after a quick Google search for garlic sausage instead of reading Kenji's responses to comments and the full article attached to the recipe article.\n\nNonetheless, it works beautifully. Test the beans when you check the crust and add water as you need. The salt pork and sausage add plenty of salt (and the dish is salty overall, but it's a bean/sausage/salted pork stew after all). Using the gelatin will get the crust if you are patient (and using an enameled Dutch oven seems to help).\n\nThe whole point seems that with some general guidelines, cassoulet has a lot of leeway in making it to suit tastes, available ingredients, and the poor reading comprehension of certain emulators (read: me). I have found my new thing to cook for the week ahead."

Just have a few questions and wanted to post some minor refinements to your recipe that worked for me.\n\n1. Scraping the blackened bits off the charred onions and ginger prevents it from dissolving and darkening in the soup.\n\n2. The parboiling step is too long. Most of the gunk and proteins come off after 5-10 minutes. Also, why would you overcook the brisket and chuck in boiling water for 15 minutes? Adding them to simmering stock afterwards doesn't add a noticeable amount of debris.\n\n3. I like my soup more herbal, and add about 1.5x-2x spices as well as black/green cardamom. This is totally optional and your ratio is pretty good. But you need to toast the spices(strange as you advocate this in many of your other recipes). I toast the bigger spices on the wire rack over flame with the onions and ginger and smaller ones either in oven or in pan on stovetop. \n\n4. My family never adds fish sauce to the soup while its boiling. 1/4 cup over 4 hours = smelly kitchen and doesn't add noticeable difference. I add at the end before serving and some on the table to add to taste.\n\nOther than these steps, everything else makes a great soup! The rehydrated noodles are key to avoiding the soggy boiled noodles you get at home. I hope you update this recipe soon because it is close to excellent. \n\nLast thing - please change the awful picture at top. Everything is wrong! Mint in the soup is just wrong, looks like rice vermicelli instead of banh pho, flank is cut too thick and lemon cut oddly. It doesn't do this recipe justice."

I recommend adding a couple of celery sticks and 1 carrot (both cut into 2 - 3 pieces), or adding 1 daikon cut into 2\" pieces for extra flavorful broth. Depending on how large my pot is and whether these 3 varieties are in my fridge, sometimes i add only carrots, sometimes carrots and celery, and for an extra large pot all 3. I've found oxtail, flank and brisket can cloud up your soup so be sure to parboil them with bones and remove impurities. You can also use a fine mesh strainer to make the borth clear as well. I did not have to strain the broth yesterday at all. I also placed it in the fridge to let the fat coagulate the next morning for a delicious healthy soup. It takes practice to get the soup this good and flavorful but worth learning how to do it right. The best part about cooking it in a crock pot is you don't have to worry about it throughout the day. It's done when you get home and the house smells amazing. Bon appetit!"

I used 80/20 beef from the grocery, spread it loosely with my fingers on a sheet pan into loose, fairly thin, piles of burgers. The pan sat in the fridge overnight. Patties were heavily salted/peppered before gently placing 2-per 8” thick-bottomed non-stick, nearly smoking hot pans. \nThere was enough of a pool of fat around the patties to fry and crisp both sides up well and the insides were a bit over cooked but still tender. The slice of Kraft American was SO bom! I’m not sure I’ll grease up my kitchen (windows open, fan and exhaust on high!) but everyone loved the burgers!! Cheers to those who did the work of figuring this out - I just don’t have the money or will to go as far as the instructions but appreciate the whole idea. Cheers!"

I can get used to these real fast! \n\nI used a chuck roast that I portioned, with a little additional suet that WF gave me for free. Probably a little more than 16oz overall, the patties were just slightly larger than 4\" in diameter. Anyway, chilled all the grinder parts in the freezer, cubed up the meat and suet and chilled that for 15-20 minutes. Ground the meat/suet mix directly to a lined cookie sheet then used the spat to form/gently press into patties. After forming, I put the cookie sheet with patties back in the freezer for a bit (5-10 min) while I heated up the pan. I think this helped them maintain shape when transferring to the pan. \n\nSince the patties were a little larger than 4\" diameter...and I was cooking for two, I used an 11\" saute pan instead of the 8\". Fired up the burner to warm the pan, added a little Canola, turned the exhaust on low (we have a 36\" Wolf range and a big exhaust hood with a commercial style external blower...on high, this sucker can pull smoke and flame out of the fireplace!). For grease spatters, I used a, well, spatter guard. No fuss, little muss for grease and smoke. \n\nPulled the patties out of the fridge, salt and peppered one side then gently slid the spat under and transferred two patties (salt-n-peppered side down) to the now smoking hot pan. Then salt and peppered the top side. The patties held up perfectly. After about 2.5 minutes, gently flipped the patties...again they held up, no breaking apart, and coated the top with some grated cheddar (grate the cheese well ahead of time and let it come to room temperature, mellow). Another two minutes and onto a toasted kaiser roll (will use softer bread next time!), a little lettuce and onion and viola!\n\nBig beefy, juicy flavor...I can definitely get used to this!\n\nOther than the roll being a little too crusty, the"

One deviation: I'm using 100% ground chuck (it was on sale) and ground in a food processor (burger lab technique), not a meat grinder. The idea here is fantastic, and the meat has come out tasting awesome. But I'm encountering an issue: when I gently press the ground meat together, the \"patty\" falls apart when put in the frying pan, and flipping was a disaster. Happened twice in a row. I don't want to overwork the meat, but has anyone else had falling apart problems? \n\nIs it using chuck, or grinding in a food processor? Should I pick up the meat and try to form it a little bit?"

Second, I am one of THOSE parents who will never, ever, ever, not ever take my kid to McDonald's, which means some of the food memories I treasure, I can't experience with said offspring unless it comes directly from my kitchen. I absolutely have to eat a certain way if I want to be able to function and that means any form of purchased junk food is 100% off the list. Third, I LOVE these super-involved, time-intensive, labors of love, especially for football food! The Vikes are playing at home for the official season opener, so that means junk-food-football-food! Away games are tailored to regional specialties. \n\nUsing this magnificent piece as a template, I was able to create a garlic-free, tomato-free, paprika-free, capsicum-free, gluten-free representation of a \"junk\" fast food item that would have otherwise been unattainable. \n\nI started by rubbing the ribs last Tuesday with my own rub that was riffed off your all-purpose rub, getting them into their water bath on Thursday. After a 36 hour soak, they chilled until I was ready to smoke on Saturday with heavy amounts of hickory smoke. The pork shoulder was also cubed and salted then. On Sunday, I ground and formed the meat mixture and made my BBQ sauce (which starts with making Stella's cherry reduction from her BraveTart site to get super dry pureed cherries as a stand-in for tomato paste) using the Balsamic BBQ sauce on here as a rough template. I always have a batch of the dilly refrigerator pickles available, so I didn't need to do anything else with those. Sadly, as I've never been able to create a not gross gluten-free bun that actually holds up under a decent level of fillings, the short-cut store-bought version had to be subbed in here.\n\nSo good! So, so, so freaking good!!! Worth the work, worth the wait. I was nearly at stalker-level-fan-girl before....now my love for you (in an \"I know you don't know me but because internet I can think and pretend I know you kind of way\") and all you've done to expand my cooking skills is way over the top. Thank you seems under-serving for my level of appreciation."

Once the cheese is added it is out of this world yummy!

Also, my grandma's recipe for broccoli-cauliflower soup uses Velveeta -- maybe Panera got the recipe from her?! \n\nI'm guessing @jim554 doesn't have to eat gluten free for a living -- if he did, he'd know that \"idiots\" put gluten in all kinds of hidden sources every single day... probably the same type of people that start off a recipe review with \"this is dumb.\""

With a really exceptional Brandywine or similar, you can get a single thick slice (say 3/4 inch) to cover the entire sandwich. For years I have used a layer of thinner tomato slices, as in the photo, but I have finally come to realize that as the joy of the BLT is showcasing this star, the most luxurious way to do so is with a steak like slab of wonderfulness."

It's a more integrated lettuce structure than loose shredded, and fresher, and cheaper. The resulting 'cross section' orientation gets maximum mayo/tomato/grease absorption, and you bite into it vertically as well, which matters. It really is The Best Sandwich"

To me the tomatoes are not down graded with the other flavours, they still are the central focus. I also have a little trick I use in cooking the bacon. I like to form a lattice with the cut to size bacon strips, so that they fry as one sandwich sized piece. I do this to make the construction of the sandwich easier (no bacon strips sliding out)."

This recipe is truly one of the best. \n\nI used a tenderloin cooked to 135 sous vide then just quickly seared on all sides. You can avoid having your sauce come out too thin or too skimpy by cooking the mushrooms until ALL their juices evaporate, cooking the umami concoction until completely evaporated, reducing the wine until it is mostly gone then using a little judgement about how much to reduce the chicken stock mixture and how much pasta water to use at the end, if any. It really makes a generous amount of silky, flavorful sauce for any reasonable amount of noodles for 4 servings (again, you might need to use some judgement).\n\nI followed the recipe exactly because I absolutely trust Kenji and it did take me more like an hour and a half but it should go faster next time now that I am familiar with the recipe."

When I learned to cook, my volume guidelines were predicated on feeding 8 hungry people. My husband likes leftovers, so this works for him. I hit it out of the park with this endeavor. After the second night I froze individual portions. My husband requested and devoured beef stroganoff eight consecutive nights and was visibly disappointed when it was no longer a dinnertime option. I followed the recipe more closely than usual. I did use a less tender cut of meat, jaccarded and sliced it. I made a dry rub of the salt, pepper and smoked paprika and braised it while a prepped the other ingredients. The layers of flavor created a sophisticated and addictive blend. I made this recipe about six months ago and my husband requested it for his birthday dinner this Wednesday. I plan on tripling the recipe this time around. Kudos to the person who perfected the Ultimate Beef Stroganoff."

Repeat the folding process once more, then roll the dough again into a 12-inch square. Use a 3- to 4-inch biscuit cutter to cut out rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced 2 inches apart. Press together scraps to form additional biscuits. Brush tops with cream and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve."

It's super delicious, and I personally think it resembles chorizo a lot. I've eaten TONS of different Mexican chorizos, and they've all had their own unique flavor with some kind of inexplicable underlying sameness. This was no different.\n\nI had to use dried lentils, because I couldn't find canned anywhere. I also only had those cheap green and orangey ones :X. I know it's annoying when people make a recipe differently than written and then write about their experience, but I really wanted to make this, had visited three stores, and was just ready to use what I had on hand, haha. \n\nI simmered the lentils for about fifteen minutes, drained, and then did the crisping method described in the recipe. I ended up broiling them a bit just to get them extra crispy... they're weirdly addicting to eat all on their own, so I'll make extra next time. I saved some to add right before the mixture is ready for dinner, so they retain their crispness. \n\nI did the 15-minute crispy method for the chorizo mixture, and it's still not as crispy as I'd like, but I think that's because I was working in a 10-inch TFal. Probably what I'll do is just pull out the amount we need for tonight's dinner (sopes), and I'll crisp that up on its own. Should be faster with a smaller amount of mixture. Gonna freeze the rest.\n\nThis took me about an hour and a half start to finish, including washing the dishes. Thanks for the effort you put into this! I'm not usually a faux meat kinda person, but I really felt like the sopes needed something indulgent."

I doubled the recipe and plan to freeze it in smaller bags. \n\nOne note - I used tinfoil-lined pans to dehydrate the lentils as instructed, and when I went to add them to the mixture on the stove, it was tough to remove the lentils (some of which had stuck to the foil) without the foil tearing. I tried to remove the foil pieces, but can't be sure I got them all. Next time, I'll use parchment paper or no liner at all, as I don't think I can safely use this batch in the microwave without some potential fireworks...!"

When I make this again -- and I certainly will -- I will probably make more of the crispy lentils (which are a brilliant idea) and put about half of them in after everything else is cooked. The lentils were still a great textural contrast, but not crunchy anymore.\n \nI'm not a vegetarian but I like to eat my weeknight meals mostly vegetable based. The biggest thing this is missing from real chorizo is that magic that the aliums, spices, and chilis have when cooked in pork fat. So I'm very tempted to try using schmaltz rather than the coconut oil that I used. Lard would probably be better, but I usually have some schmaltz from making stock."

I'm not one to make a roast and then make the sole vegan eat only the sides or some kind of sad salad while we pig out. I made your Provencal Tian and between that and this dish we all -feasted- on vegan deliciousness and were completely satisfied. That sauce is unctuous in the best sense of the word and loaded to the top with umami. Those king oyster mushroom lardons were amazing. I can't believe the chew they had along with that delicious mushroomy essence I love. \n\nI'm making this again tomorrow with the other half of that block of tofu and the other king oyster that was in the pack we got.

It’s so good that it gave me the reassurance I needed to go majority vegan (I don’t have hard rules , but, these days I mostly eat that way). I literally keep a jar of the sauce in my fridge to throw over pasta when I’m feeling lazy like it’s mac and cheese, it’s so easy to make from shelf stable ingredients that it’s a game changer. Often I use whole sauerkraut instead of just the brine because I don’t mind the texture and don’t like to waste it (I wouldn’t eat it too much otherwise). The mushrooms are so good, I don’t want to cook them any other way now. My only note is that this amount of pepper is kind of ungodly, I usually half it. I’m not normally one to comment on anything or review anything at all. But this recipe is perfect and this website has otherwise generally changed my life, I love to cook now and feel confident enough to invent my own things now, thanks for being geniuses."

The smell of the nutritional yeast was so off-putting, that I took it off the table at once, packed it up and took it home. Not wanting to waste, I thought id give the dish another try the next day. I heated it in the microwave and once the sauce warmed through, the dish turned out quite welll!!! The stank was gone!! Heating it thoroughly made a HUGE difference!! Not sure how you all read the recipe, but I doubt warming it over the stove while coating the noodles would have done the trick. Make sure to hear the sauce through!!"

In a stand mixer, that liquid can be transformed into a creamy, fine, stable foam with the texture, density, and many of the cooking properties of an egg white–based meringue. Today, we&#39;re using it to make light, fluffy pancakes.",

I saw the other comments mentioning it was too forward. These pancakes were the most savory I've ever had before; I can understand wanting to add a zesty or floral undertone. Next time I might try only half the zest it calls for or maybe experiment with lavender.\n\nThe second was doubling the baking powder. I saw a YouTube video mention that using 4 whole tsp's was their secret to supremely fluffy mouth feel. This recipe has the whipped aquafaba though and I think that wasn't necessary.\n\nFriendly reminder (because I've messed up pancakes multiple times and I finally got a good result): FOLD in your dry ingredients and whipped aquafaba. DO NOT \"MIX\". You don't want to exert any force into the batter because it will break down the lather. Don't fear lumps.\n\n10/10 Would recommend, spiritually"

I also added 1/8 tsp. of cream of tartar to the aquafaba before I whipped it. \n\nIt seemed to work very well, requiring only about 2 minutes to form stiff peaks in the whipped aquafaba. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I doubt most people could tell they don't contain animal products.\n\nI agree with the person who said the lemon zest was a bit too forward for a standard pancake, but still tasted good. I'm putting this in the good old standby recipe file!"

This was because I am far away from every type of soy except from Kikkoman's standard sauce, which I didn't feel like using, but I can get Marsala by driving 20 km. The sage came from my garden, where I had to cut down my sage quite a bit, so now I'm eating all the sage recipes."

I have found a couple of things that can be done to change it for the better, depending on what the cook wants to do. For one thing, chopping the sage and sprinkling it on the cutlet, and then laying the prosciutto BEFORE pounding is very effective in adhering the prosciutto to the veal. just have to be very gentle when pounding. Also, start off prosciutto side down in the pan, just to make it all stick, and then flip over and cook through.\nAnother option is to forgo trying that presentation at all, and cooking the cutlets as normal, without the sage/prosciutto slice, and instead making a richer pan sauce, and garnishing the sauce with prosciutto and sage.\nIt's fun to do the thing with the layer of prosciutto the first time you make it, but after that the novelty wears off and you may find that by doing it a bit more conventionally, it actually tastes better, too."

The problem is that the recipe doesn’t contain enough oil and sherry vinegar. I made this today and wondered why it was so bland. I compared it with the recipe I’ve used in previous years (LA Times) and found that for the same or similar quantities of bread, almonds, and water, the LA Times recipe contains 1/4 c. of sherry vinegar, 1/2 c. olive oil, and 3 cloves of garlic. You can go light on the garlic if garlic isn’t your thing, but the extra olive oil dramatically improves the soup’s texture and the extra vinegar really brightens the flavor. Highly recommend upping the oil and vinegar if you use this recipe."

Then we blended it, and froze it again in the quart container for a little over 8 hours. Even with these changes, our custard turned out perfectly!

Which is why I discovered I like to bake, it's still art but done in a scientific manner. Have you written a book on such a process? I have been looking for a book that explains to me the why behind baking. For instance, needing salt to activate baking soda. How would a newbie ever know that? The difference between room temp eggs and fridge temp eggs. Things along these lines. Have you written such a book or know of such a book you can direct me towards. I like the way your brain works.

There's a reason Kenji spent a paragraph in the accompanying article writing about how specifically replaced the milk with evaporated milk to up the protein/fat content to make a smoother ice cream by reducing ice crystal formation. By modding the recipe to both reduce the eggs (provides fat and protein and stabilizers) and replace the evaporated milk with cream/milk (resulting in slightly more fat, way less protein), you're going to get a different result. If Kenji says:\n\n\n\n>It was an improvement—enough that I'd use evaporated milk in all of my ice cream from now on. \n\n\n\nI'm going to take his word on it. \n\n\n@Cindy108\n\nThe only difference between this and the ice cream machine method is the use of the food processor/blender to break up to frozen cubes. To make an ice cream base for the machine, you'd need to use the stove/mixer anyway to make the base and you'd have to pre-freeze and clean the core of the ice cream machine after so it comes down to 1 extra bowl to wash. Ice cream machines aren't magic. They just mix and cool at the same time. It takes the same amount of work and prep to get to the same end result.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the ice cubes are stuck and for some reason you don't have a silicone ice cube tray or the hard plastic kind that you can twist to loosen the cubes (like the OXO one SE recommends), you can just dip the bottom of the tray in a baking sheet of warm water to slightly melt the outside and it should just pop out."

Typically we just use Rocoto or Aji Amarillo straight up (at least in my community). Two tips:\n\n- Make twice the amount that this recipe calls for - it blends more easily and this recipe just makes very little in general when you consider how fast you run through this!\n\n- If your sauce is thin, use unsalted saltine crackers to thicken it up in the blender - this is very common in Peru.\n\nThanks for the great proportions and break down of the ingredients, it's pretty spot on!"

I prefer to not buy fillets or steaks pre-cut since you don't know what you are actually getting. I like to hand pick the fish for quality then clean it and cut it myself. When available, I'll purchase fresh flown-in fish. I found a beautiful blue parrotfish from Hawaii and a California scorpionfish. Super fresh with clear eyes and delicious flesh. I was happy! \n\n~Chieko"

Scrub and BAKE THEM at 400 or 425 until a fork finds no resistance. \n2. Then, holding each with a pot holder, break open and scoop out with a spoon. (Fast, easy, no peeling, and FLUFFY AS A NEWBORN LAMB. Well, fluffier.)\n3. Then, most importantly, add only warmed ingredients!!! Otherwise, danger of gumminess!\n4. Warmed 1/2 and 1/2, melted butter, perhaps some sour cream, salt, white pepper-- to taste. And I use a hand mixer-- slowly, minimally. (Arthritis has caught up with me.) They are so good that my daughter called from the Surinamian jungle for ideas on duplicating them with cassava and goat's milk."

Or, just add the milk a little at a time because the amount of moisture absorbed will vary from potato to potato."

Put in the oven for 8 hours, or till fork turns easily when testing from the side if the roast. Remove the roast, tent, which means to lay foil over the roast. It can sit between 15 minutes to 2 hours. Turn your oven up to 500 degrees. Take foil off the roast and return to the oven. Every 5 minutes turn the pan a quarter turn. Not flipping it. Just the pan. It will crisp the skin. Remove after the 20 minutes is up. Let sit 15 minutes and voila it is ready. Bon appetit."

I also peeled back the skin and put the seasoning on the meat and used toothpicks to hold it in place. It shrank back a lot, but the meat was still moist. When I removed the pork to rest while heating the oven, I tossed some skin on potatoes in the rendered fat and seasoned them with Montreal Steak seasoning and cooked them in a roasting pan while the oven was reaching 500, for maybe about 20ish minutes. Sooo delicious. Super easy. Much much better than the slow cooker version that I made last time."

I have had them go from six to twelve hours, but eight hours is a good average. There is a point in the cook, about 160 degrees, where they go into a holding pattern and will stay at the same temp for hours. That is the fat and collagen is rendering out and making the meat tinder. I usually smoke two butts at a time, with one of them I will foil it after fours or so and that one yields a lot of juice to add to both on them when pulled. At the time of pulling I \"spray\" the meat with apple cider vinegar and add some red pepper flakes. I am doing a brisket for Christmas and I will have two butts on the rack above the brisket to baste it while cooking. One thing that is good about cooking butts is they are very forgiving if you over cook it.\n\nTenting is draping or loosely covering the foil over the meat."

I overboiled by a couple of minutes and ended up cooking in a cast iron for 15, flip, then another 15. \n\nTossed in the oil (room temp) with salt, pepper, oregano and fresh garlic. They were amazing. Can't wait to try with duck fat when I'm not cooking on a whim at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday. And can't believe I've never tried this method before. I can't imagine doing it any other way now."

This might be more subjective and more to the British taste but I find the 500f (250c) a bit odd. 380f for about 1 hour - 1 hour 30 is the standard in the UK. I builds up a stronger and dare I say crunchier coating in my humble opinion. All I ask is this: did you experiment with temperatures or is the 500f a US standard and it was a no brainer for you?\n\nBy the way, I need to thank you for making my life better - the bar style pizza using a tortilla has blown minds south of the river. I have won friends and influenced many people with this (and may have passed off as my own)."

                    "reviewBody": "The method is super reliable as are the results. I was in the middle of juggling the oven times and temperatures to produce three things that needed to be served immediately for best results. The potatoes are time consuming (I needed to make 3 kilos instead of 2), and the success of the salmon was the prime issue. I needed to know from the start how I could manage the potatoes by doing as much as I could hours before the crunch time. My convection was not cooking two pans at a time. It was taking forever! All that turning and shaking was eating up time. so I took one pan out of the oven half baked, so to speak. I set them aside, and they cooled. Would that be a bad thing?\nSomeone had suggested cooking them on a wire rack set into a baking pan to get the heat flowing over the whole lot, one pan at a time. I used a teflon-coated rack over an ordinary dark oven pan and transferred the pieces onto it. Bingo! I never had to touch them again! And the fact that they had cooled completely in their half baked state was no problem. They came out with excellent overall color and crispiness with the soft interior.\nEven though the answer was buried in the comments, people still had problems getting the herbs to stick to the potatoes. I had warmed a few tablespoons of my oil of choice and poured it over the hot, fully-cooked potatoes in a large bowl. I tossed the potatoes until uniformly covered with the oil then distributed the herbs over the pile and tossed them again. Voila. Some fell to the bottom, but I gently stirred them up over the potatoes with a spatula. Most of the herbs stuck all the way to the table. \nI had to take all this food to a dinner ten minutes door to door. Alas, the potatoes did cool off, but a short warm time in the host oven didn't hurt them at all. Despite all the starts and stops, the potatoes were a hit.The only thing I would do differently is give the wire racks a quick coat with cooking spray as four pieces stuck a little one they were done. \nThis recipe is not a stand-alone item on a menu. I'm sure a ton of potatoes was used in the development of the recipe. Things must have happened along the way. My experience was anecdotal and I no longer have the fire power in my now small kitchen to do the full testing of results. Are the results truly as good? I know that even in the future, I have to fit them into a dinner prep schedule. Anything I can do to streamline the process has to be done. What do you do?"

I did use a box grater and a Belgian waffle maker and I added some minced onion, so I had some variations to contend with and I think I should have squeezed them out some more. The total cooking time was about 11 minutes, and the ridges were thicker than I wanted due to using the Belgian waffle maker, and I probably should've let them go another couple of minutes to get them crispier (too hungry to wait any longer) but the results were good. I think next time I'll try my panini maker to see if I can get them to come out a little thinner and a little crisper."

It is a delicious waffle-shaped pastry. Choux pastry and churro batter are essentially the same ingredients and ratios. These waffles taste delicious and are easy to make, much simpler than deep frying churros. They are lighter than fried churros, but they have the same base flavor. They are definitely worth making.

Agree also that while they aren't really churros, they can be delicious and I think using the waffle iron is genius. The result can be very satisfying if you don't think of it as a churro but rather a crunchy, slightly sweet, creamy treat. \n\nNote to Woohoo: Hiding behind the veil of anonymity to criticize the creative efforts of people who publish ideas online (for FREE no less), only speaks poorly of you. Please have the courtesy to abstain from commenting or rating recipes until you have actually tried them, and then please show consideration. I've spent plenty of time in Spain and realize this isn't a Spanish churro. Nobody ever claimed it was! You may be surprised to know the Portuguese and even Chinese have equal claim to the origination of the humble churro (Google \"you taio\").\n\nI rate this 5 stars for creativity - it inspired many spin offs that have put smiles on the faces of me and my family. This fall try adding pumpkin and sweet spices topped with caramel sauce. \n\nNote to other reviewers: These worked great with my Villaware Belgian waffler. If you have inconsistent results, try a friend or neighbor's."

A grand total of 30min lapsed between my seeing this recipe, and eating my first waffle churro. AMAZING! Is this a waffle. No. Is this a churro. No (well, kind of). Does it matter if the batter is quite thick before putting on the waffle iron? No, just dump it out in the center of your waffle iron and close the lid. In fact, \"real\" churro batter also has to be pretty thick in order to squeeze it out of the star tip and have it hold shape in the fryer without turning into an amorphous blob. The end result of this recipe is a lightly cinnamon scented, churro-like waffle with a crispy exterior. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I'll add a bit more cinnamon to both the batter and also the cinnamon sugar. This recipe basically makes having a churro substitute a realistic dessert (cough... or lunch or breakfast) in my home."

The dressing tasted good but very sweet, and seemed to be a lot for the volume of vegetable -- of course you can always add more!"

Cup a portion of dough beneath your palm and work in quick, circular motions to form a tight skin around the ball, with only a tiny seam along the bottom. If the seam is large or irregular, continue rounding until the bottom is nearly smooth. Cover with plastic and let rest 15 minutes. Poke a hole into the center of each portion with a damp fingertip, then gently stretch into a 1 1/2–inch ring, wetting your hands in cold water as needed to prevent sticking.

Fill a stainless steel pot with about 3 inches of water, stir in malt syrup (if using), and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet or cutting board with a thick layer of paper towels. Working with three or four at a time, boil the bagels, about 15 seconds per side. Place on paper towels, then immediately transfer to the prepared half sheet pan. (If left on the paper towels too long, the bagels will stick; if this happens, quickly dip the bagel back into the hot water, and the wet paper towel will peel right off.) Bake until blistered and golden brown all over, about 18 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before proceeding to the next step, or store mini bagels up to 36 hours in a paper bag."

If you have some spicy italian sausage laying around, cook it first, use the rendered fat instead of (or in addition to) the olive oil to cook the mirepoix, and add the sausage back to the soup at the end. It adds another layer of flavor, taking this into richer territory.\n\nAnd I'm not sure I'd classify the parm rind as \"optional\" - I think it's a pretty integral element of the stock. Definitely not nearly as interesting without it."

There is the expectation from JKLA to season this dish on your own, and he gives you tthis license from his printed book (if not from this particular recipe). I use all of these umami boosters in this soup as well as most of his slow cook recipes, and it has glorious results. Lemon juice is recommended from other users (salt-fat-acid-heat), and is great, but don&#x27;t sleep on adding some hot Italian sausage and/or pork sausage to this recipe if you are not overly concerned with this being vegitarian or meat-free."
